	<h2>The Atlantic Salmon Ecosystems Forum</h2>
    <h3 class="meeting-theme">Time flies: Atlantic Salmon as an endangered species twenty years later</h3>

	<h3>January, 2020<br>
	Location: <a href="directions.html">Wells Conference Center</a>, Orono, ME</h3>
	
	<p>The Atlantic Salmon Ecosystems Forum (ASEF) began in 2002 as the biennial 'Maine Atlantic Salmon Technical Advisory Committee Research Forum.' In recent years, the focus of the meeting has shifted somewhat in response to evolving research priorities and management needs to improve our understanding of the ecosystem processes that influence riverine, estuarine, and marine habitats. This holistic approach enhances our understanding of multi-species interactions by generating novel insights into the multiplicity of factors affecting diadromous species survival, population dynamics, ecosystem structure and function from headwaters to the ocean. </p>
	<p>We hope to attract a diverse audience interested in engaging in meaningful discussions pertaining to the past, present, and future of diadromous species science, management, conservation and restoration, with an emphasis on re-establishing lost biological, physical, and social connections between and among humans, habitats, and fish.</p>
