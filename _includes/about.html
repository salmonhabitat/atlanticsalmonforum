	<h2>The Atlantic Salmon Ecosystems Forum</h2>

	<h3>January 6-7, 2016<br>
	University of Maine, Orono ME<br>
	Well Conference Center</h3>
	
	
	<p>The Atlantic Salmon Ecosystems Forum (ASEF) began in 2002 as the biennial "Maine Atlantic Salmon Technical Advisory Committee Research Forum".  In recent years, the focus of the meeting has shifted somewhat in response to evolving research priorities and management needs designed to improve our understanding of the ecosystem processes that influence riverine, estuarine, and marine habitats. This holistic approach is designed to enhance our understanding of multi-species interactions and offers novel insight into the multiplicity of factors affecting diadromous species survival, population dynamics, ecosystem structure and function from headwaters to the ocean.</p>
	
	<p>The 2016 ASEF will blend diverse research and management topics, presenting a cohesive overview of contemporary knowledge, management actions, an evaluation of on-the-ground restoration initiatives, and potential paths forward.</p>
