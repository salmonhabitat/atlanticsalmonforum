	<!-- <p>	Invited and contributed abstracts for presentations and posters for the 2020 Atlantic Salmon Ecosystems Forum are now being accepted. The submission deadline is December 1, 2019 and authors will be notified of selection soon thereafter. Please format your abstracts as per the <a href="/guidelines.html">guidelines and example provided</a> on the ASEF web page.
	</p>	

	<p>	A broad spectrum of topics will be considered including but not limited to:</p>

	<ul>	
		    <li>Ecosystem Dynamics			 </li>
		    <li>Population Assessment		 </li>
		    <li>Fish Passage and Distribution</li>

	</ul>	
	
	<p>Under the theme, <em>Time flies: Atlantic Salmon as an endangered species twenty years later</em>, speakers are encouraged to critically evaluate their successes in science, management and restoration, 20 years since the Endangered Species Act listing in 2000, while outlining paths forward that promote recovery.</p>	
	
	<p>	A Keynote Address delivered by <a href="https://umaine.edu/mitchellcenter/people/david-hart/" target="_blank">Dr. David Hart</a>, Director, <a href="https://umaine.edu/mitchellcenter/" target="_blank">Mitchell Center for Sustainability Solutions</a>, University of Maine, will provide a framework for thoughtful discussion on the past, present and future of Atlantic salmon recovery in the region.</p>
